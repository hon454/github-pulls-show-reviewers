# Pull Request Guideline

This document covers PR titles, descriptions, issue linkage, and the
co-location checklist for this repository.

## Title

PR titles follow the same rules as the
[commit subject line](./commit-guideline.md#header):

- `<type>(<scope>): <subject>`
- Lowercase type and scope, imperative subject, no trailing period,
  ≤ 80 characters.
- One concern per PR.

For breaking changes, add `!`:

    feat(reviewers)!: drop dismissed-state chips

Breaking PRs also include a `Breaking Changes` section in the body.

## Description template

Every PR uses the same expanded template, populated by
[`.github/pull_request_template.md`](../../.github/pull_request_template.md).
Sections that do not apply to a given PR should still be present:
for `## Impact`, `## Testing`, and `## Breaking Changes`, leave a
short "None", "N/A", or "not applicable" so the reviewer knows the
author considered the section. `## Summary`, `## Why`, and
`## Changes` always carry content, and `## Related Issues` always
carries one of the forms listed under [Issue linkage](#issue-linkage)
— `Resolves`, `Part of`, or `No issue: <reason>` — never "None".

    ## Summary

    -

    ## Why

    <!-- What problem does this solve? Why is this needed? -->

    ## Changes

    <!-- Summarize by behavior, subsystem, or reviewer concern. -->
    <!-- Do not provide a file-by-file list unless file location is essential. -->

    -

    ## Impact

    - User-facing impact:
    - API/schema impact:
    - Performance impact:
    - Operational or rollout impact:

    ## Testing

    - [ ] Unit tests
    - [ ] Integration tests
    - [ ] Manual testing

    ### Test details

    -

    ## Breaking Changes

    - None

    ## Related Issues

    Resolves #123
    (or) Part of #123
    (or) No issue: <reason>

### Writing each section

- **Summary** — 1 to 3 bullets describing the main outcome. Not a
  filename list; focus on behavior or reviewer concern.
- **Why** — a few sentences explaining the motivation or problem
  being solved. Avoid restating the summary.
- **Changes** — group by behavior, subsystem, or reviewer concern.
  Examples: user-facing behavior, validation logic, data model
  changes, performance improvements, test coverage.
- **Impact** — call out anything release owners or reviewers should
  notice. Use "None" when genuinely empty.
- **Testing** — check what was actually run; the Test details list
  should describe concrete verifications rather than "tested
  locally". Record pnpm lint / typecheck / test results and any
  manual Chrome verification in Test details.
- **Breaking Changes** — state "None" for additive changes. A PR
  that carries `!` in the title must describe the break and the
  migration path here.
- **Related Issues** — see the Issue linkage section below.

## Issue linkage

Every PR states exactly one of these in its body:

- `Resolves #123` — closes the issue on merge (documented default).
  GitHub also recognizes `Closes #123` and `Fixes #123`; prefer
  `Resolves`.
- `Part of #123` — partial progress, link only, does not close. This
  is a textual link, not a magic word.
- `No issue: <reason>` — intentionally untracked. Give a one-line
  reason.

Multi-issue form: `Resolves #123, #124`.

For loose relationships to issues the PR does not close, comment on
the issue and link the PR rather than adding more magic words to the
PR body.

## Assignee

Maintainers and collaborators assign every PR to its author. When
using `gh pr create`, pass `--assignee @me`. When creating through
the web UI, set the assignee to yourself.

Outside contributors opening a PR from a fork generally cannot
assign PRs in this repository; the maintainer will set the assignee
on merge-track PRs. No action is required from the contributor.

## Co-location checklist

Before opening the PR, walk through these questions. When an item
applies, the same PR should carry the matching update.

1. Did reviewer UX behavior, copy, or the set of supported review
   states change? — update `README.md` "What The Extension Shows"
   and `docs/implementation-notes.md`.
2. Was `src/github/selectors.ts` touched? — add or update
   fixture-based regression coverage under `tests/`.
3. Did `wxt.config.ts` `permissions` or `host_permissions` change? —
   update `docs/privacy-policy.md` "What the extension accesses" and
   `docs/chrome-web-store-submission.md`.
4. Did the storage schema change (`src/storage/`, Zod records)? —
   update `docs/privacy-policy.md` "Storage and retention".
5. Did auth or device flow change? — update
   `docs/manual-chrome-testing.md` scenarios.
6. Was a new entrypoint or major module added or moved? — update the
   Repository Map in **both** `README.md` and `AGENTS.md`.
7. Was `package.json` `version` bumped? — add
   `docs/releases/vX.Y.Z.md`.
8. Was a new durable design decision made? — add or update
   `docs/adr/NNNN-<title>.md`.
9. Did release verification (`pnpm verify:release`) change? — update
   `README.md` "Pre-release Test Workflow".
10. Did Chrome Web Store user-facing copy or screenshots change? —
    update `docs/chrome-web-store.md`,
    `docs/chrome-web-store-submission.md`, and
    `docs/chrome-web-store-assets/`.

The PR template includes an optional co-location note; use it to
confirm which items applied or record "none".
